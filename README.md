# clj-ocr

A Clojure wrapper for Tesseract OCR

## Usage
Before using you must download train data for the language that you would like to preform OCR on.
A function has been included to simplify this.
Simply run 
> (get-lang-data "<ISO 639-3 standard language code>") <

Example:
> (get-lang-data "eng")

for English or
> (get-lang-data "deu")

for German in the clj-ocr.utils namespace to download.
Codes can be looked up [here](https://iso639-3.sil.org/code_tables/639/data)
not every language code will work. It pulls from [here](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata)
